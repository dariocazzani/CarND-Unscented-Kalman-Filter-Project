# Object Tracking using Lidar and Radar sensor data - Unscented Kalman Filter
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Goal of this project
Uilize a Kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements.
The goal is to obatin low RMSE values for the estimated parameters: position in the x and y axis, and velocity in the x and y axis.

## Data
This project involves the Term 2 Simulator from Udacity which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)
Data is read from and to the Simulator by the C++ program. See file `main.cpp`

## Reading data from the Simulator:
This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and install [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO. Please see [this concept in the classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/16cf4a78-4fc7-49e1-8621-3450ca938b77) for the required version and installation scripts.

## Run the project
Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project top directory.

    1. mkdir build && cd build
    2. cmake .. && make
    3. ./UnscentedKF

Then open the simulator and click on start.

## Results

### Final RMSE Values:

        rmse_x:  0.0647
        rmse_y:  0.0836
        rmse_vx: 0.3350
        rmse_vx: 0.2193
